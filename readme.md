Ok so i wanted to make it more complex but im not yet an expert at figuring these things out.

I had to research some DOM manipulation stuff because I'm not yet up to those lessons on either my
Udemy course, my freeCodeCamp course, or my Odin Project course.

Oh Well. It's pretty simple and seems kinda nice.

Wish I could introduce more wackiness to the aesthetic.
